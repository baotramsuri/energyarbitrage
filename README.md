This project uses linear programming (LP) to optimize the energy dispatch of a grid-connected PV-BESS system. Assuming real day-ahead (DA) electricity prices in Finland are known in advance, a simulation model is developed to determine the optimal hourly power allocation between selling electricity to the grid, charging/discharging the battery, or curtailing PV output. The objective is to maximize energy arbitrage revenue under realistic operational constraints. The model is implemented in Python using the PuLP library with the CBC solver.<img width="468" height="160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c64dc98d-7a7c-465d-97f8-2774273fb7a3" />
